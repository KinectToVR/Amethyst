## **Docs / Wikis**
I try to document the code as I go (not to forget stuff), it should kind-of readable and understandable.<br>
For questions about how something works or how to use it, please search through this repo, or just ask.<br>

Currently, all available docs (as for plugins) is [the K2TrackingDevice-Samples repo](https://github.com/KinectToVR/K2TrackingDevice-Samples).<br>
~~To learn about the Amethyst API (K2API for short), please go to [the k2vr-application repo](https://github.com/KinectToVR/k2vr-application/wiki).<br>~~
~~(Though, in [the k2vr-application repo](https://github.com/KinectToVR/k2vr-application/wiki), you're going to find only the old, default API methods)~~
