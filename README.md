# **For Developers:**

## **Build & Deploy**
Both build and deployment instructions [are available here](https://github.com/KinectToVR/Amethyst/blob/main/BUILD_AND_DEPLOY.md).

## **Devices / Plugins Samples**
You can find Amethyst plugin samples in [the K2TrackingDevice-Samples repo](https://github.com/KinectToVR/K2TrackingDevice-Samples).

## **Docs / Wikis**
I try to document the code as I go (not to forget stuff), it should kind-of readable and understandable.<br>
For questions about how something works or how to use it, please search through this repo, or just ask.<br>

Currently, all available docs (as for plugins) is [the K2TrackingDevice-Samples repo](https://github.com/KinectToVR/K2TrackingDevice-Samples).<br>
To learn about the Amethyst API (K2API for short), please go to [the k2vr-application repo](https://github.com/KinectToVR/k2vr-application/wiki).<br>
(Though, in [the k2vr-application repo](https://github.com/KinectToVR/k2vr-application/wiki), you're going to find only the old, default API methods)

## **Beta Rating**
From time to time, Amethyst may ask what do you think about the current build - you just rate it.<br>
This is meant to tell us if the latest changes are good or bad, and to help us improve the next build.<br>
You can opt-out clicking `Don't ask me`. <ins>This is anonymous, no personal information is collected.</ins><br>
Everything is being done via an [Azure Application Insights](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-monitor/app/app-insights-overview) instance, and fully managed by Azure.
